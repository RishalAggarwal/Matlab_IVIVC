## Importing Data

Matlab provides an in-built tool for importing data from csv and excel sheets. More about it in this [link](https://in.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/importtool.html). 
For this workflow we mainly import the data in the form of column vectors. A representative screenshot for the same is give below.
